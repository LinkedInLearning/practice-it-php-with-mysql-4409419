## Instructions
This repository has only one branch. The files used in each assignment and the instructor's solutions are in numbered directories that correspond to the chapter and movie number (CHAPTER#_MOVIE#). For example, `01_02` contains the files needed for the first exercise and `01_03_checkit` contains the instructor's solution to the first exercise.

Each numbered directory contains two sets of files. The `tasks` directory uses PHP code in the procedural style. The `tasks_oop` directory uses PHP in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style. You can use whichever style you prefer and ignore the other directory.

## Codespaces
This repository was designed for use with GitHub Codespaces. The course explains how to use it.

When launched, the Codespace will automatically create a database and populate it with sample data. You can write PHP code directly in the Codespace. Then, you can start a web server in the Codespace and view the web pages in a new browser window.

## Installing and Using
1. Launch a Codespace.
2. Start a webserver.
  - Switch to the `Terminal` tab in the bottom frame of the Codespace.
  - Type `apachectl start` and hit return.
  - You may need to start the webserver again if the Codespace is restarted.
3. Open a new browser tab to view web pages.
  - When the webserver starts, a pop-up window will appear in the lower right.
  - Click the option to "Open in Browser".
  - A new browser tab will open and show the output of the index.php page.
4. If needed, the browser tab can be opened another way.
  - Switch to the `Ports` tab in the bottom frame of the Codespace.
  - Find the line for Port 80, hover over "Local Address", and click the globe icon that appears.
5. Write your code.
  - In the Codespace, navigate to the directory that corresponds to the current exercise.
  - Write your code for the exercise directly in the Codespace.
  - Save your work.
6. View the web page.
  - Switch to the other browser tab.
  - Add the path to the PHP page to the URL.
  - Example: https://[your-codespace].app.github.dev/01_02/tasks/show.php
